### Code Style

Code style is equivalent to the Visual Studio default code formatting settings, namely:

* Tabs
* when using anonymous functions, put a space between function and the parenthesis ```function () {```
* no spaces around parameters, only after commas
* Use semicolons
* no newline before curly braces
* single quotes for strings
* tests, tests, tests. If you change something and it's testable, there **has** to be a test
